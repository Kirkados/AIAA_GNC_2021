"""
These two Classes build the Actor network and Critic network.
The actor network receives the state and calculates the action.
The critic network receives the state and action and calculates a q-distribution.

The q-distribution represents the probability that the value of this state-action pair
is in a certain bin. Each of the outputs corresponds to a probability that the true
value lies in a given bin. This strategy yields better results than simply estimating
the value of the state-action pair, as we have a full distribution to work with rather
than just the mean.
